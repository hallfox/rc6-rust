This implementation of RC6 was written in the Rust programming
language with permission from the professor. It was not tested on
bingsuns as that machine doesn't have a rust compiler.

The code has been tested and runs with the Rust compiler version 1.11
and above. If you install the rust compiler and cargo, its project
management system it can be run with

cargo run [input file] [output file]

Or, it can be compiled with rustc and then run as a binary

rustc src/main.rs
./main [input file] [output file]

The source code also includes tests for the first two tests provided
in the RC6 paper. They can be run with

cargo test

If you're having difficulty running this or don't wish to install the
rust compiler on your system send me an email and I will demonstrate
it on my system as soon as possible.
